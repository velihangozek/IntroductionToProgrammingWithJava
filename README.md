# IntroductionToProgrammingWithJava

In this repository, I've started to work from variables and datatypes. After that, I've implemented the conditionals and switch statements as being the first part of the control flow. After these, I've continued to study with loops. As the last part of the introduction to programming concepts; arrays, strings and methods have been implemented via different coding scenarios.
